# Matthew Albrecht Assignment

## How long did you spend on the assignment.

5-6 hours

## What do you like about your implementation.

It's extendable, If hour incremenets were needed it wouldn't need a large rewrite.

## What you would change if you were going to do it again.

The more dynamic styles like columns or grid-row-span should be directly on the element rather than tailwind classes. I'd probably add a state management tool like zustand or react-query depending on where we want changes to the data to be stored.

## How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.

I looked at [this timeline component](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/timeline/) for design inspiration.

## How you would test this if you had more time.

I'd write unit tests of some of the more complex functions, ie createEventList, createEventMap. I'd add snapshot testing.

## How to run locally

To run the project locally, use the command `npm run dev`.
